## Tutorial for Beginners

Perfect if you are new to BridalBuddy, this section will walk you through all the most basic features of BridalBuddy and will make sure you know everything you need to get started.


### Tutorial Contents
1. [**Starting a fresh template**](#starting-a-fresh-template)
2. [**Adding guests**](#adding-guests)
3. [**Adding vendors**](#adding-vendors)
4. [**Deleting persons**](#deleting-persons)
5. [**Exiting the program**](#exiting-the-program)


**Let us explore the most basic features of BridalBuddy's from the perspective of a wedding planner.**
When you open up the application for the first time, you will see the interface below, with some sample guest and vendors on the guest list and the vendor list respectively.

![Ui](images/firstUseUi.png)

At the top of the screen, there is a text box we will refer to as the *Command Line*. This is where you type in your commands to BridalBuddy, and you confirm your instruction by pressing the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key on your keyboard.
Below the *Command Line* is the *Outcome Box*, which will tell you the outcome of the commands you have entered, as well as other relevant information related to that command.
Finally, below the *Outcome Box* is the *Display Panel*, which will contain the guest list and the vendor list for the wedding that you are planning.

### Starting a fresh template

In order to get ready to use BridalBuddy, let's first remove the existing sample guests and vendors on our guest list and vendor list.
All we have to do is to enter the command `clear` in the Command Line, and both the guest list and the vendor list will be emptied and ready for you to plan a new wedding.
> :bulb: Remember to hit the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key on your keyboard to confirm an instruction/command to BridalBuddy.

Once successful, you should see the following on your screen:

![clear command](images/clearCommand.png)

[_Back to Top_](#table-of-contents)


### Adding guests

Let's say your customer, the groom, sends you the first guest he wishes to invite, and we want to add him to the guest list of the wedding.
Let us familiarise ourselves with the `add_guest` command, which you will need in order to add guests to the guest list.

Let's try entering the following command in the Command Line: `add_guest n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25`.

This means you are adding a new guest, with the name `John Doe`, phone number `98765432`, email `johnd@example.com` and address `311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25` to the guest list.

Once successful, you should see the following on your screen:

![add guest_command](images/addGuestCommandSample.png)

For more details on the `add_guest` command, such as the additional optional fields you can classify a guest with, we encourage you to refer to [**Adding a new guest to the guest list**](#adding-a-guest-add-guest)

[_Back to Top_](#table-of-contents)


### Adding vendors

Let us now add a vendor to the list of vendors you are intending to collaborate with, and familiarise ourselves with the `add_vendor` command, which you will need in order to add vendors to the vendor list.

Let's try entering the following command in the Command Line: `add_vendor n/Jane Tan p/91234567 e/janet@example.com a/743, Jurong Mall, #05-245 c/Jane's Florist`.

This means you are adding a new vendor, with the name `Jane Tan`, phone number `91234567`, email `janet@example.com`, address `743, Jurong Mall, #05-245` and company name `Jane's Florist` to the vendor list.

Once successful, you should see the following on your screen:

![add vendor_command](images/addVendorCommandSample.png)

For more details on the `add_vendor` command, such as the additional optional fields you can classify a vendor with, we encourage you to refer to [**Adding a new vendor to the vendor list**](#adding-a-vendor-add-vendor)

[_Back to Top_](#table-of-contents)


### Deleting persons

Suppose the bride tells us that she has a preferred florist in mind, and so you need to delete the florist you previously added to the vendor list.

Let's try the entering the following command in the Command Line: `delete_vendor 1`.

This means you are deleting the first person that is currently being listed on your vendor list, which is `Jane Tan`.

Once successful, you should see the following on your screen:

![delete vendor_command](images/deleteVendorCommandSample.png)

Deleting a guest works in a similar way but using the `delete_guest` command instead.
For more details on the `delete_guest` and `delete_vendor` commands, we encourage you to refer to [**Deleting a guest from the guest list**](#deleting-a-guest-delete-guest) and [**Deleting a vendor from the vendor list**](#deleting-a-vendor-delete-vendor) respectively.

[_Back to Top_](#table-of-contents)


### Exiting the program

It's been a long day at work. Now let's take a break and exit the application. All you have to do is simply enter the command `exit` in the Command Line, and the program will exit automatically in a few seconds!

* :information_source: Not to worry, your progress will be auto-saved and all your work will be reflected correctly the next time u open the app.

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**:bulb: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `â€¦`â€‹ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]â€¦â€‹` can be used as `Â ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
