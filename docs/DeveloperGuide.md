## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete_guest 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Guest`, `Vendor` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete_guest 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteGuestSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteGuestCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteGuestCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteGuestCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a guest).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddGuestCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddGuestCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddGuestCommandParser`, `DeleteGuestCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

Note: `Vendor` and `Guest` both extend from the abstract `Person` class, which defines common attributes and behaviors shared by both types of entities.

The `Model` component,
* stores the address book data i.e., all `Guest` and `Vendor` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Guest` / `Vendor` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Guest feature
The `add_guest` command creates and adds a new `Guest` object into the address book. The attributes of the `Guest` are specified through prefixes and their corresponding values 

The sequence diagram below provides an overview for the execution flow of a `add_guest` command:
<puml src="diagrams/AddGuestSequenceDiagram.puml" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `AddGuestCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

Explanation:
1. The `execute` method of `LogicManager` is called with the user input as the argument to begin the command execution
2. `AddressBookParser` parses the user input (if valid) to create and return an `AddGuestCommandParser`
3. `AddGuestCommandParser` parses the user input (if valid) to extract the prefixes and their corresponding values, which is used to create a `Guest` object with the specified attributes (`Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Address`). An `AddGuestCommand` is then created with the new `Guest` object and returned.
4. `LogicManager` executes the `AddGuestCommand`, which calls the `addPerson` method of the `Model` to add the guest into the address book.
5. A `CommandResult` containing the success message is then returned to the `LogicManager` and then back to the `UI` component

### Find feature
The `find` command searches for all guests and vendors that match the given keyword(s) and displays them. The prefix specified in the command indicates the attribute to be searched

The sequence diagram below provides an overview for the execution flow of a `find` command:
<puml src="diagrams/FindSequenceDiagram.puml" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `FindCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

Explanation:
1. The `execute` method of `LogicManager` is called with the user input as the argument to begin the command execution
2. `AddressBookParser` parses the user input (if valid) to create and return a `FindCommandParser`
3. `FindCommandParser` parses the user input (if valid) to extract the prefix and its corresponding value, before calling the corresponding parse predicate method to create the corresponding predicate to be used. In this case, since the name prefix is specified, the `parseNamePredicate` method is called to create `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`. A `FindCommand` is then created with the predicate and returned.
4. `LogicManager` executes the `FindCommand`, which calls the `updateFilteredPersonList` method of the `Model` with the predicate as the argument.
5. A `CommandResult` containing the success message is then returned to the `LogicManager` and then back to the `UI` component

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Data Requirements**
1. Size: The system should support storage for up to 300 guests and 300 vendors per wedding. 
1. Volatility: Guest lists and vendor details may change frequently, especially closer to the event date. Therefore, the system must accommodate dynamic data updates and edits.
1. Persistency: All guest and vendor information must be saved persistently in a JSON file and remain accessible even after system shutdown or failure.

**Environment Requirements**
1. Operating System: The system must be compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.
1. Dependencies: Java 17 should be the core language.

**Accessibility**
1. Provide help documentation that can be accessed at any time with a simple command (help).

**Fault Tolerance**
1. The system should handle errors such as missing commands or invalid input gracefully, providing clear error messages without causing system crashes.
1. Ensure that invalid input (e.g., incorrect email format) does not result in data corruption.

**Performance Requirements**
1. The system should respond to user input within ten seconds, even for lists of up to 300 guests and 300 vendors.
1. System startup time should not exceed ten seconds on standard hardware.

### Glossary
**Technical**
*  **CLI**: Command-Line Interface, a text-based interface used to interact with software by typing commands.
*  **GUI**: Graphical User Interface, a user interface that allows users to interact with the app through graphical elements such as buttons, text fields, and menus.
*  **JAR**: Java Archive, A file format used to package Java applications and libraries into a single, compressed file
*  **JSON**: JavaScript Object Notation, a lightweight data-interchange format for structuring and exchanging data

**Non-technical**
*  **Guest**: A person invited to the wedding.
*  **Vendor**: A supplier providing services or goods for a wedding, such as photographers, florists, caterers, etc.
*  **RSVP Status**: The attendance response status of a guest. It can be either confirmed, pending, or declined.
*  **Tag**: A keyword or label assigned to an entry to categorize and easily filter it within the list.
*  **Index**: A numerical value representing the position of an entry in a list, used to reference and perform operations on the contact.
